# CODSOFT Python Internship  
## Task 1 – To-Do List Application  

This project is my Task 1 submission for the CODSOFT Python Internship.  
I built a simple To-Do List application in Python with both **CLI** and **GUI** versions, so users can manage their daily tasks easily.

 What this project can do
- Add new tasks  
- Edit existing tasks  
- Delete tasks  
- Mark tasks as **done/undone**  
- Store all tasks permanently using a JSON file  
- Use either a clean **command-line** interface or a **Tkinter GUI**  

I kept the project simple, beginner-friendly, and fully functional.
